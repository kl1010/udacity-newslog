# Logs Analysis Project
While working on this project I decided I will actually make a website out of it so here we go a Flask Website.

## How to Run this?
You can create a folder on the vagrant directory and run ```newslog.py``` from ```virtual box```.
```python
python newslog.py
```
Then you should be able to go to ```https://localhost:8080``` to view the website.
Alternatively, I will be hosting one at ```http://104.236.85.232:8080/``` as a reminder I might move that.

## About the charts
Charts are made using google charts you can read more about it at <https://developers.google.com/chart/>

Charts data are not dynamic right now, I do plan to make them so. 

## Working Example
